## Reflection

This project was originally created in vanilla JavaScript as part of FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript curriculum, but I recently decided to rebuild it in Node.js. Through this project I was able to hone my skills in routing with Express, get and push requests with EJS, and using HTTP requests to dynamically influence the UI.
